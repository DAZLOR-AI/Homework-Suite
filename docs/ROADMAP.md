# Homework Suite Delivery Roadmap

## Phase 1 — MVP (3–4 months)
### Goals
Validate core value: homework transforms into game sessions that students complete more consistently.

### Deliverables
- Identity and profiles (student/teacher/parent roles)
- Homework intake (photo/PDF/manual)
- OCR + basic parsing and subject classification
- 3–4 core game loops (Math Racer, Quiz Dungeon, Flashcard Arena, Puzzle Quest)
- Points, streaks, level progression, badges
- Student dashboard with basic mastery and history
- Web + one mobile platform

### Exit Criteria
- Parse success rate and gameplay completion meet target thresholds
- First closed beta with 50–100 students

## Phase 2 — Expansion (2–3 months)
### Deliverables
- Additional subject-specific game templates
- Adaptive difficulty and recommendation engine v1
- Social layers: friends, leaderboards, class challenges
- Teacher portal basics: assignment creation and class analytics
- Second mobile platform support

### Exit Criteria
- D7 and D30 retention improvements over MVP baseline
- Teacher workflow validation in pilot classrooms

## Phase 3 — Personalization & Integrations (3–4 months)
### Deliverables
- Parent portal and weekly reporting
- Advanced personalization and review scheduling
- LMS connectors (Canvas/Google Classroom/Moodle starter)
- Improved analytics and intervention tooling

### Exit Criteria
- Demonstrated learning-outcome lift in pilot cohorts
- Operational readiness for district-level deployments

## Phase 4 — Scale & Optimization (ongoing)
### Deliverables
- Performance and cost optimization
- Accessibility hardening and localization
- Seasonal events and content operations workflows
- Continuous experimentation and A/B testing framework

## Cross-Phase Engineering Standards
- TypeScript-first implementation
- Unit + integration + E2E test pyramid
- CI/CD with quality gates
- API and architecture documentation maintained per release
